# Personal Website

This is a website eventually meant to display my personal projects.  
The website is written in Angular, with authentication being handled by Google Firebase and authorization being handled by a REST node.js server.

Currently it is being used to host an admin panel, used to turn various servers running on my computer on/off remotely.

It is currently being hosted on a local computer via nginx, and can be found at https://edwardgomez.dev  
(There is not much to see there, eventually I will make a demo version of the admin panel for others to easily see)
